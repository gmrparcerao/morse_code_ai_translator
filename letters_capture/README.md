# Instructions

This component is a PlatformIO project responsible to capture the Morse Code of the alphabet letters via an ESP32 and send them to the PC via serial, so the code can be written into a database to train the neural network.

Flash these code on an ESP32 and mantain the same connected to the PC while letters_CSV_writer is executed on the PC, so the Morse Code electrical pulses can be captured to a database.
